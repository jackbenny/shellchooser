# Shellchooser #
Shellchooser is a Bash script meant to run as a users shell, althouh it is not
a shell of it's own, it's an interactive chooser for different shells.
The shells avaliable to choose from in the script is Bash, Ash and Csh. It uses
`dialog` to display a nice menu. Since the script is meant to run before the
user has a sane environment all binaries used by the script is being run from
variables. The variables for the binaries are generated by a loop which uses
`which` to get the path for the binaries. The `which` command is hardcoded and
might need to be changed on different systems.

## Usage ##
Bundled with shellchooser is a small Makefile to ease installation of the
script. Simply run `make install` to install shellchooser.sh into /bin and the
profile/bashrc/cshrc files into /etc/shellchooser. The installation also put
/bin/shellchooser.sh into /etc/shells so that system utilities won't complain
about it not being a valid shell.
